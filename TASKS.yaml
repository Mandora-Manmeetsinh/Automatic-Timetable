Mandatory Requirements Implementation
A. Faculty Subject Preferences
•	Faculty Input:
•	Teachers submit their subject preferences and availability at the start of each semester.
•	Preferences are ranked and stored in the system for allocation logic.
•	Preference Matrix:
•	A Subject Priority Matrix is created based on faculty inputs.
•	The system calculates a Subject Assign Point (SAP) for each faculty-subject pair.
B. Assignment Based on Criteria/Designation
•	Designation-Based Allocation:
•	Teachers are assigned subjects based on their designation, expertise, and seniority.
•	Senior faculty and department heads are prioritized for certain subjects or fixed slots.
•	Rotation Policy:
•	Ensures no teacher is assigned the same subject more than twice in a row, if required.
C. Fixed Slots Prioritization
•	Fixed Slot Scheduling:
•	Fixed slots (e.g., labs, lectures for senior faculty) are scheduled first.
•	Prioritized by designation, shift, and other institutional policies.
D. Elective Subjects Allocation
•	Elective Subject Handling:
•	For classes with multiple elective subjects, the system checks that all relevant teachers are available at the same time.
•	Elective lines are managed to prevent clashes and ensure all subjects can be offered.
•	Student Grouping:
•	Students are grouped by elective choice, and timetables are generated accordingly.
E. Load Balancing
•	Workload Distribution:
•	Loads are assigned based on designation, subject schema, and institutional policies.
•	The system ensures fair distribution and prevents overloading of any faculty member.
•	Maximum Load:
•	The maximum teaching load is capped at 18–19 hours per week, in line with academic standards.
•	The system prevents assignments that exceed this limit.
F. Timetable Outputs
•	Teacher Timetable:
•	Shows teacher details, subject codes, teacher IDs, emails, and assigned domain (lab/lecture) for each division.
•	Master Timetable:
•	Displays all loads and classes for each teacher.
•	Room Allocation:
•	Indicates which classes are scheduled in which rooms, ensuring optimal use of space and resources.
7. Additional Features
•	Iterative Improvement:
•	The system allows for incremental adjustments and fine-tuning of the timetable.
•	Conflict Detection & Resolution:
•	Automatically detects and resolves scheduling conflicts.
•	Export Options:
•	Timetables can be exported in PDF, Excel, or other formats for sharing and printing.
•	Data Traceability:
•	All changes and allocations are logged for audit and review purposes.
8. Benefits
•	Eliminates Manual Overhead:
•	Reduces the time and effort required for manual scheduling.
•	Resource Optimization:
•	Ensures optimal use of teachers, classrooms, and other resources.
•	Error Reduction:
•	Minimizes administrative errors and scheduling conflicts.
•	Scalability:
•	Suitable for small and large institutions alike.
•	Transparency & Fairness:
•	Promotes equitable workload distribution and transparent allocation processes
